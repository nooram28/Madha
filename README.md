New version

I've included everything as in the requirements:

Classes:
	I created two classes: one for courses and one for students.
	Each course has an ID, a name, a prerequisite (if any), and a list of enrolled students.
	Each student has an ID, a name, and a flag to indicate if they've paid their fees.

Methods:
	In the course class, there is a method to add students to the course. 
	There is also a method in the course class to display the enrolled students.

	In the student class, there are methods to check if the student has not paid fees 
	and if they have passed a prerequisite course.

IMPORTANT
Error Handling: I added statements so the program lets the user know what is the problem.
Readability: I tried to keep everything clear and easy to understand.
